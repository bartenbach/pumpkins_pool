# What is ◎?
The Solana currency symbol for SOL. 5◎ is read as 5 SOL.

However, there are actually two different units of Solana currency: The **SOL** and the **lamport**. A lamport is a much smaller unit of the currency and can be used to gauge much smaller transactions.

From the Solana documentation
> Lamports are named in honor of Solana's biggest technical influence, Leslie Lamport. A lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.
