## Hey there! 👋

Pumpkin's Pool is a solar-powered, independently owned & operated Solana stake pool.

### Clean Energy 🌞
We are committed to doing the right thing for the environment, which is why we participate in the [Community Solar program](https://pubdisplay.alsoenergy.com/kiosk/18014398509527082?dashkey=2a5669734965576e4a43513d3d&tag=4246267).

**5%** of all profits go directly towards clean energy.

### Decentralized 🕸️
Stakeholders help keep Solana decentralized. By investing in independently owned and operated pools, they prevent corporate takeover and giant clusters from forming in the same datacenter.

This keeps Solana distributed, fair, and unbiased.
