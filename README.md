## Hey there! 👋

Pumpkin's Pool is a Solana stake pool focused on animal welfare and environmental preservation via solar energy.

### Clean Energy 🌞 🌲
We're committed to doing the right thing for the environment, which is why we participate in the [Community Solar program](https://pubdisplay.alsoenergy.com/kiosk/18014398509527082?dashkey=2a5669734965576e4a43513d3d&tag=4246267).

### Decentralized 🕸️
By staking with Pumpkin's Pool, you keep Solana distributed, fair, and unbiased.

### Blazingly Fast 🧨
Don't let green energy give you the wrong impression - we're a Tesla, not a Prius. We're powered by some of the latest and greatest server technology on the market.

### Solid Returns 💰
So here's the thing: We actually care about our mission. A lot. The planet matters, and together we can make a difference.

That's why we've decided to waive all fees until 2023.

**100%** of staked rewards go directly to our stakeholders.

In 2023, we will reasses our business model and decide on a commission rate that will best accomplish our mission. Stakeholders will be notified well in advance of the projected commission rate change, and given ample notice to redelegate if they wish to do so. This will be posted here on the Pumpkin's Pool website, and also in the PP (Pumpkin's Pool) Discord.

Then, our promise remains exactly the same: **5%** of all profits go directly to providing clean energy and improving the welfare of animals without homes.

### Security 🔒
#### Physical Security
Pumpkin's Pool is hosted in a building with very tight physical access controls, a UPS backup, a daily automated backup system, and has 24/7 monitoring and alerting.

#### Network Security
Validators must manage three important keypairs.
- The *Identity* keypair which signs all transactions
- The *Voting* keypair which stake accounts are delegated to
- The *Authorized Withdrawer* keypair which enables Solana tokens to be moved to and from the validator.

The first two keys are required many times a second and must remain on the Validator server, but are also backed up nightly. The third keypair is the *Authorized Withdrawer* Keypair, which is stored offline in cold storage in an actual vault. There is absolutely no risk of the key being compromised as it is not physically connected to a computer.

#### Could I lose my tokens?
No, this is not currently possible. However, the Solana foundation plans to implement slashing in the future, so it still makes sense to choose your validator wisely.
