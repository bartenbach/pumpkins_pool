## Hey there! 👋

Pumpkin's Pool is a solar-powered Solana stake pool focused on environmental preservation and animal welfare.

### Clean Energy 🌞 🌲
We're committed to doing the right thing for the environment, which is why we participate in the [Community Solar program](https://pubdisplay.alsoenergy.com/kiosk/18014398509527082?dashkey=2a5669734965576e4a43513d3d&tag=4246267).

**5%** of all profits go directly towards clean energy.

### Decentralized 🕸️
Stakeholders help keep Solana decentralized. Diversifying prevents corporate takeover and giant clusters from forming in datacenters.

This keeps Solana distributed, fair, and unbiased.

### Blazingly Fast 🧨
Pumpkin's pool is powered by the latest servers with Intel Xeon Gold CPUs, DDR4 memory, and several terabytes of SSD storage.

### Solid Returns 💰
With a competitive commission of only **10%**, stakeholders acquire **90%** of staked earnings.

Commission not only covers operating costs, but is invested directly back into the pool's infrastucture. A percentage of all profits are used to procure additional solar energy shares.

### Security 🔒
#### Physical Security
Pumpkin's Pool is hosted in a building with tight physical access controls, UPS power backup, daily automated backups, 24/7 monitoring, and alerting.

#### Could I lose my tokens?
This section of the [Solana documentation](https://docs.solana.com/staking#:~:text=When%20a%20validator%20is%20slashed,to%20their%20reduced%20total%20delegation.) describes how staked tokens can be lost:
> You risk losing tokens when staking through a process known as slashing. Slashing involves the removal and destruction of a portion of a validator's delegated stake in response to intentional malicious behavior, such as creating invalid transactions or censoring certain types of transactions or network participants.
> When a validator is slashed, all token holders who have delegated stake to that validator lose a portion of their delegation. While this means an immediate loss for the token holder, it also is a loss of future rewards for the validator due to their reduced total delegation.

Essentially, this happens when a malcious validator attempts to cheat the network. You can avoid this by ensuring you are only delegating stake to pools you trust. If anything seems sketchy or out of place, move along.
