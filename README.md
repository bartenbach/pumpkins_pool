## Hey there! 👋

Pumpkin's Pool is a Solana stake pool focused on animal welfare and environmental preservation via solar energy.

### Clean Energy 🌞 🌲
We're committed to doing the right thing for the environment, which is why we participate in the [Community Solar program](https://pubdisplay.alsoenergy.com/kiosk/18014398509527082?dashkey=2a5669734965576e4a43513d3d&tag=4246267).

### Decentralized 🕸️
Stakeholders help keep Solana decentralized. Diversifying prevents corporate takeover and giant clusters from forming in datacenters.

This keeps Solana distributed, fair, and unbiased.

### Blazingly Fast 🧨
Pumpkin's pool is powered by the latest servers with Intel Xeon Gold CPUs, DDR4 memory, and several terabytes of SSD storage.

### Solid Returns 💰
With a competitive commission of only **10%**, stakeholders acquire **90%** of staked earnings.

**5%** of all profits go directly to providing clean energy.

### Security 🔒
#### Physical Security
Pumpkin's Pool is hosted in a building with tight physical access controls, a UPS power backup, daily automated backups, 24/7 monitoring, and alerting.

#### Key Security
Validators must operate with three important accounts/keypairs. The Validator Identy keypair which signs all transactions, the voting account keypair which stake accounts are delegated to, and finally the authorized withdrawl keypair which enables Solana tokens to be moved to and from the validator. The first two keys are required many times a second and must remain on the Validator server. These Keys are backed up on a separate secured server and encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption. The third keypair is the Authorized Withdrawl Keypair, which is stored offline in a vault. The private key is not connected to the internet in any way, and never will be.

#### Could I lose my tokens?
This section of the [Solana documentation](https://docs.solana.com/staking#:~:text=When%20a%20validator%20is%20slashed,to%20their%20reduced%20total%20delegation.) describes how staked tokens can be lost:
> You risk losing tokens when staking through a process known as slashing. Slashing involves the removal and destruction of a portion of a validator's delegated stake in response to intentional malicious behavior, such as creating invalid transactions or censoring certain types of transactions or network participants.
> When a validator is slashed, all token holders who have delegated stake to that validator lose a portion of their delegation. While this means an immediate loss for the token holder, it also is a loss of future rewards for the validator due to their reduced total delegation.

Essentially, this happens when a malcious validator attempts to cheat the network. You can avoid this by ensuring you are only delegating stake to pools you trust. If anything seems sketchy or out of place, move along.
